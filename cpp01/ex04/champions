I've paid my dues, time after time
I've done my sentence, but commited no crime
and bad mistakes I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
but I've came through
(and I need to go on, and on, and on, and on)

we are the champions, my friend
and we'll keep on fighting
till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
cuz we are the champions
of the world

I've taken my bows, and my curtain calls
you brought me fame and fortune and everything
that goes with it
I thank you all
but it's been no bed of roses
no pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before whole human race
and I ain't gonna lose!
(and I need to go on, and on, and on, and on)

we are the champions, my friend
and we'll keep on fighting
till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
cuz we are the champions
of the world

we are the champions, my friend
and we'll keep on fighting
till the end
we are the champions
we are the champions
no time for losers
cuz we are the champions
of the world
